# Future plan

## ***UNDO***
this is too important of a thing to be missed, bro u know what i mean? not having a **undo** button in an editor is like no Jerusalem in the western world, purely unacceptable

## multi-languaging
just some extra work i guess. json file maybe?

## web avalible
i belive by using emscripten and wasm we couold run this c++ project on web
in a way im kinda pro on doing this
ÂìàÂìàÔºÅÊ©ôÂÖâÔºåÂêØÂä®ÔºÅüçä

## bundle creation for mac
i need to create a bundle for the mac version of this, or atleast the environment set up, or ppl might spend forever trying to set the environment

## multiple windows
can open multiple project in the same time? (i wonder who would do that though, nobody would, right?)

## spirit libary
a libary that contains all spirits imported so far, with tags or folders that could seperate them maybe?
(wow i tried so hard to not load all texture, but here we are)

## stored spirits
since setting the picture to the same position is just annoying, i am hereby thinking that there should be stored data that could just be pulled out as the spirit is pulled out. Maybe remember how the spirit is used last time and show it like that when pulled?

## stored textbox
the textbox setting could be save so that it can be pulled out immediately? im imagining something like a list of textbox presettings with nicknames

## import / replacing / deleting images
should i store it in jpg or texture... I would prefer jpg though
oh btw, should i set the image to be at least / at most certain size? can't think of why i should, but that sounds very pro.

## resolution
currently the window can be dragged any size and could resize in whatever, but characters (which i mean like, human?) are in best always in a ratio right? not gonna be fat(

    what about if ratio's different, always show <all_of_shorter_side> * <part_of_longer_side> that kind of size calculation? am i able to let the user choose on showing which part of longer side? complicated

## animation
man Codename Bakery's animation is too good, i need good animations in this game egine too. At least some simple motion and video player right? right??

## voicing
honestly can't really imagine ppl using this application to makes games that contains voicing, but one need to have dream, so i'm gonna add this feature.

## memory
i think opening the project and the project opens at the last modification is a cool thing. though is this really necessary?(

## drag
i mean, editing is very needing dragging, i think it's a must

## edit windows?
like you know, all other engines like unity or sai2, where you have a window showing the game inside the big host window. though it's not cool

## *or*, dragging imgui window outside host window
this is cool, i like it

## buttons
if i want to do setting then i need buttons, if i have buttons there should be icons, if there are clickable icons, ~~then why don't i just make a point-and-click game engine then~~ should i limits its feature or just make them able to do anthing
